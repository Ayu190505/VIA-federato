# VIA-federato & Adaptive Workflow Engine - Hackathon Submission

## 🚀 Overview
This project enhances user engagement on the Federato RiskOps platform by implementing an **Adaptive Workflow Engine**. The system utilizes **causal inference, predictive modeling, and interactive graph visualizations** to optimize user navigation and maximize session efficiency. 

## 🏗 Features

### 🕸 Interactive Event Graph
- Allows users to **visualize event relationships** dynamically.
- Nodes represent different user actions, with edges showing transitions.
- Judges can **drag, resize, and explore** event clusters to identify patterns.

### 🔍 Causal Inference Engine
- Identifies key user actions that impact retention.
- Surfaces insights on feature usage bottlenecks.
- Helps optimize workflow interactions.

### 🔮 Predictive Path Model
- Forecasts the most probable next action based on historical user behavior.
- Personalizes recommendations to guide users efficiently.
- Improves engagement by suggesting optimal workflow steps.
